# gauge_kpi 
An animated gauge indicator, using canvas.

This is a gauge indicator web component, which you can add to your own web pages, 
using this html sample code, you can copy--> paste the canvas and script objects.

Be sure you have gauge.js library included in your js folder, or if you use a
different location for your javascript, just change the src attribute in the
script object.

It's very colourful, animated and sizable to fit your needs, but please keep the
shape relation 4x3 of width x height. We recommend at least 200 x 150 px in order
to see all details.

You can use it in addition to your preferred Framework library.
